## Git vs. GitHub
Git is installed and maintained on your local system rather than in the cloud and github is let you manage Git repositories


---
## Initial Setup
Set up git with your user name and email. Open a terminal/shell and type
Set up ssh on your computer. I like Roger Peng's guide to setting up password-less logins
Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings. Go to your github Account Settings


---
## Repository Setup
In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select New repository
Type a short, memorable name for your repository
Optionally, add a description of your repository
Choose to make the repository either public or private
Select Initialize this repository with a README
Click Create repository
